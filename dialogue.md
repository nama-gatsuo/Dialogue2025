EXCITED to start this collaborative work! :ï¼‰

I just created a basic shader with simple position-based coloring.
The shader uses (chaotic) position transformations with Gaussian 
time modulation for organic movement patterns.

Please check README.md first and feel free to add your thoughts!
Looking forward to seeing how you'll respond to this foundation!!!

The concept is nice! Clear and well-instracted!
And already the visual is coolðŸ˜‚ Wave manupulation and gaussian blurring feels like magical mathmatical phenomena.
I did minor tweek on output image like modulation, color control with pow().
Today was cloudy/rainy in Tokyo, so I felt like I need a bit of bright/colorful image.
