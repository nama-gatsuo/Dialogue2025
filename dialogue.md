EXCITED to start this collaborative work! :ï¼‰

I just created a basic shader with simple position-based coloring.
The shader uses (chaotic) position transformations with Gaussian 
time modulation for organic movement patterns.

Please check README.md first and feel free to add your thoughts!
Looking forward to seeing how you'll respond to this foundation!!!
