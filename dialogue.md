EXCITED to start this collaborative work! :ï¼‰

I just created a basic shader with simple position-based coloring.
The shader uses (chaotic) position transformations with Gaussian 
time modulation for organic movement patterns.

Please check README.md first and feel free to add your thoughts!
Looking forward to seeing how you'll respond to this foundation!!!

The concept is nice! Clear and well-instracted!
And already the visual is coolðŸ˜‚ Wave manupulation and gaussian blurring feels like magical mathmatical phenomena.
I did minor tweek on output image like modulation, color control with pow().
Today was cloudy/rainy in Tokyo, so I felt like I need a bit of bright/colorful image.

(was worried yesterday but I'm so happy you like this!ðŸ˜‚)

â†’ js: Added a high-resolution image download feature today! Just press s/S on the screen and you can download the high res image!

â†’ record folder: Since we can download images now,
I also created a folder to store all the downloaded pictures as a record.
Actually, we can share any files we want!

â†’ shader: I think the bright colors look amazing!!!
And today I wanted to add a little emphasis to the ripples, so I changed a bit on the color function again.
The screen now has a bit more contrast.
out_0611_01 and out_0611_02 are the beginning and after shots respectively.
I'm not satisfied with how the ripples stack up after a while though.
I need to think about what to work on tomorrow...

Yesterday I got my Fuji film photos ðŸŽž from last year, and I'm really happy with how they turned out...
I guess I really love highly saturated images.
