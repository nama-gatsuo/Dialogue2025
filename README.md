# Dialogue2025

## 🎨 About

(This could be our artist statement)
A daily creative dialogue between two artists, expressed through code and shaders.
Inspired by _ Dear Data _ and our previous work at dialog() Asia Generative Art Exhibition.

## 🎯 Rules

1. Communication: Use comments or commit messages as tools for dialogue
2. Complete Freedom: Any code can be modified or deleted (Maybe also no clean code...😂)
3. One Per Day: Each person tries to commit daily - even a tiniest changes matter (suggest DC notification before committing)
4. Messages as Art: Commit messages are part of the creative work
5. Document Changes: When making major visual changes, explain in comments or commit messages

## 🏗️ File Structure

- `index.html` - Main canvas
